      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",

If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).\n"
